							<br />A 2 days game jam that we hosted ourselves with a friend of mine to see what we can make in that time period. I used open-source assets for this project to save time and focus on faster production and improving the overall quality of the game. </p>

							<br />
							<br />A 3 days game jam called "ScoreSpace Jam #12". I wanted to try making my own pixel art a simple AI that can move, jump over or climb blocks and chase the player and a procedurally generated dungeon and see what I can make.

						<br /><br />
						<p>A 2D pixel art-based horror game, is heavily inspired by one of the best horror-based games 'Corpse Party'. The very main objective is to escape the cabin were you found yourself trapped inside. Collect key fragments, interact with objects, and get your way out of the cabin.

							<br />A submission we made for the "Kindred Community Jam" that lasted for 5 days. My role for this project was the programmer. I also helped in implementing the UI and audio.

						<a href="https://namtaro.itch.io/little-farm"
						style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: Bold; line-height: 35px;">Little Farm</a>
						<br /><br />
						<p>This game is inspired by classic titles such as "Harvest Moon", "Rune Factory", and "Stardew Valley". In this farming simulator, you play as a young girl named Elona trying to build her farm from scratch. Plant a variety of crops that you can sell or use it to craft items to gain more profit. 
							<br />
							<br />we had 3 people for this project and my role was a gameplay programmer. This particular project showed my flaws in planning and scoping. Although we weren't good enough to make it to the top submissions, we were still happy to finish the game in time and served as a great lesson for me, too. This game served as our entry for the "Jam with MediBang" with a seven (7) day deadline.
